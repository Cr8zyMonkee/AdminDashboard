I used HTML & CSS to build an admin dashboard that lists trenind projects, user's current project and announcements. I used flex and grid to arrange the site and create a side bar navigation menu, something which was new for me this project. I laso experimented more with using different assets and making them work together. I feel like this project helped me with understanding grid really well.
